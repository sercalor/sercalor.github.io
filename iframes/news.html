TURBA TOL HOL-HOL, The book. As a result of our collaborative work exhibited in the Chilean Pavilion, at the 59th Venice Biennale, the book is a compendium of the extensive eco-cultural thought of Latin American and Caribbean authors who center their attention on struggles, ways of doing, and experiences of care from the South. The book is a multidisciplinary, collaborative, scientific-poetic-artistic effort that recognizes itself as material/sensual and aspires to be downloadable, scribbleable, accessible, referenceable. It is designed to accompany different processes of biodiversity conservation of strengthening care practices that are specific, multinational, cross-cultural, decidedly anticolonial, participative, and feminist. The book is a desire and an act, a collective plea, a place for gathering, for divergences, for different ways of doing in pursuit of a society of care.

<p><strong>July 2023,</strong> "The Head of Śoqo Pawlu" is a series of creative accompaniments between humans and winds initiated by Chilean artist Ariel Bustamante in collaboration with writer and musician German Lazaro from the Uru-Chipaya indigenous community located in the department of Oruro, Bolivia. 
Śoqo Pawlu is a wind-person, one of many beings that circulate and manage the air of the shared deserts of Bolivia and Chile. Learning to walk together through air currents, Ariel and German promote alternative forms of coexistence between humans and winds that help us deepen our affective and vital bonds with the atmosphere while crossing different types of borders, including national, racial, and disciplinary ones.

Based on the cosmology, past, and semi-nomadic present of the Uru-Chipaya people, the audience is invited to a Thami paxś (knowing the winds), an intimate session of conversation, trans-human commensality, and bodily contact to help us recognize the limbs, bodies, memories, and personalities of the winds that constantly pass through us.

<p><strong>April 2023,</strong> Who has the sovereignty of interpretation over species and nature conservation: the affected countries in the Global South or the "First World"? The six-part series Decolonial Ecologies of the Stiftung Humboldt Forum in Berlin explores these questions and sheds light on the different power dynamics intertwined within the construction of Ecology as an academic scientific field. Decolonial Ecologies is a six part podcast hosted by Dr. Aouefa Amoussouvi that brings together academic content, grassroot and field initiatives and artistic practices. Amoussouvi’s guests challenge the Western mainstream narrative on ecology with intersectional feminist, queer perspectives, perspectives from BIPoC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color). . <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5e3GME4w7CEfpJ4Xz2cGf3?si=4e69cfd62ef04272">Episode 4, Ariel Bustamante</a></p>

<p><strong>March 2023,</strong> <em>A bridge in the air made by the smoke of burning feathers.</em> Lecture at the Sound Studies and Sound Art in Latin America Class, Tulane University, New Orleans, United States. 
This talk centers on two collective sound art practices I am part of in Karukinka (Tierra del Fuego) and the Collasuyo, in the shared deserts of Bolivia and Chile. By singing, 'raising' smoke and affiliating with the non-human I will present different spiritual technologies to collaborate, listen, and communicate between these two opposite worlds, almost 3,000 miles apart. </p>
