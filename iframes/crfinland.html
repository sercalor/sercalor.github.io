<!--<h1>Conversation Room</h1>-->


<p>Conversation Room emerged in 2015 from two years of interdisciplinary research led by Ariel Bustamente. During this time, Bustamante assembled a collaborative framework between local curators and artists to explore conversation as an experimental method for intimate encounters with the general public. </p>

<p>The final materialization of Conversation Room (CR) is a hand-made, permanent sound sculpture installed in Otaniemi, Finland. The sculpture is a sturdy house comprised of mostly organic materials that will eventually disintegrate after several decades of use. CR has been specifically designed for vocal acoustics and to hold undisturbed conversations, sound-proofing the users from the exterior. </p>

<p>Originally, the work was built on the basis of this question: Why Do We do The Things We Do? 
This question served as an oral catalyst to set the tone of the encounters with an existential problem, a problem that implied self-inquiry, intimacy, and the rehearsal of polysemic answers about the reasons behind our choices, including why we met to converse in the room in the first place. </p>

<p>Methods, considerations, oral tools, or just plain suggestions were created to face not only this question but also to face another alterity in close proximity, with another human being that is different from us. These methods are meant to inspire the participants to deal with radical forms of listening, a form of awareness that may subvert our own dear certainties in order to commit —or at least to practice a commitment— to disruptive foreign forces. </p>

<p>The team from 2015 worked closely, not only upholding, listening, and reworking conversations but also building this room with their own hands. These two, full-time years of conceptual, oral, and manual craftmanship were supported by the Artist in Residency program at Aalto University in Finland. After itinerating around Helsinki area and Espoo, the sculpture became part of the Aalto art collection while permanently relocated to the Otaniemi campus. Since then, CR has served as an oral platform for experiments in dialogue, listening and collaborative research, engaging faculty, students and many other cross-disciplinary guests. </p>
