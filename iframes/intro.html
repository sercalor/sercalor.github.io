<p><strong>Ariel:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Last year was both a good and a bad year for me, there were a lot of things happening to me at the same time, all of them intense, oscillating between stress, joy, and animosity. It put my relationships to the test, a couple of them have apparently not survived. When that year seemed to be over, I traveled back to Bolivia and I visited an Amauta, an indigenous healer, and I told him I was tired and needed to rest. He said: Then, who&rsquo;s going to take care of you while you rest? You cannot rest without someone strong taking care of you! He asked: What are your mountains? You should ask their permission for them to take care of you!. I wanted to tell you this story first, Maria, to begin our conversation in regards to the architecture of fragility and protection.</em></p>
<p><strong>Maria:</strong>&nbsp;<em>I love this idea. I mean: I need a space to talk about this, to shine a light on it. Especially now, personally speaking. As I see it, being suddenly frail, having to enter a space of rest, means letting go of control to some extent. Because no one can ever be all action and motion and agency and strive and achievement. We do run out of energy, or horizons or recursivity at some point, &hellip;in waves? And we need to sink and just be a bundle of heavy dormant ideas and stories and potential actions. Like a cat that has been wounded: they lick the wound and they sit and do nothing. It is work to get them to eat or drink even. But instinctively they are just saving all the stamina they can muster to be able to recover. And yet, there needs to be someone paying attention to make sure they stay alive while they sink. They might not. The interesting thing is that a lot of this happens to those people in society who are caretakers, custodians of a process, a place, a practice. As educator, I see myself as one. As forger of encounters I am sure you are one too, Ariel. And the job requires taking in a lot, holding space for others, being present, setting up the conditions for things to emerge, patiently, tenaciously believing the otherwise will in fact emerge. And it does, sometimes. But eventually, we also too, falter. And then the question is&hellip;Who cares for the caretaker? &iquest;Qui&eacute;n cuida al cuidador?</em></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">CONVERSATION ROOM</h1>
<ul>
<li>is a sound sculpture specifically designed to hold intimate and undisturbed long-stretched conversations. It acoustically isolates itself from external noises providing a protective, private environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is a sound archive, a repertory of hundreds of fragile voices playing one after the other, in a long timeline that might last for decades.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has room for anyone. All there it is room, precisely in these times when places have been negated and fenced in so many ways in other spaces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Invites you to linger, stay here without purpose and perhaps find it in the encounter.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More than a place for listening it is a place for mutual attention since to be present is the best way to attend others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gives intimate time alone to one another &mdash;and &ldquo;gives&rdquo; means here surrender time and privacy, A hospitality that is kind but also asks for radical honesty with each other and with oneself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A place where we may relinquish power over and over, and often find it lurking in the dark where we least expect it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Questions about how we establish what is trustworthy and who deserves our attention, our care; what requires action and what can wait.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Questions about how we do things. What are the support structures we endorse and feed with our labor? What are the solidarities we nurture? And how do we acknowledge our ancestors, our elders, our interdependence, and our expanded kin?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is a place for activating the margins, the interstices, where we connect, find our limits, and state our boundaries. Where we learn and discover. Where we thrive and we ache.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is not about information or expertise, it is an invitation to revise the multiple authorities that govern our lifes today. This is an invitation to ditch reputation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is a mirror to witness/expose the filters through which we make sense of the everyday, the future, and the past. To look at how we root somewhere, and which routes we are in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have your alarms on at all times for fillers. If you catch yourself babbling smalltalk, then stop and ask yourself deeply: why do I/ we do that? Do I need that? Where is this taking me, us? Stands for mutual disarming, not an interview nor a talk show.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is not going anywhere anytime soon. It stays in place, night and day, enduring the seasons, protecting your voice and staying strong when the individual split into pieces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is made out of plants, and plants need care, as we converse inside of plants we will never speak alone. Talking through, with and above ourselves with plants is the real spirit of sustainability, for nature to keep growing entangled with us, In other words, Conversation room promotes Conversation as a path for Conservation.</li>
</ul>
