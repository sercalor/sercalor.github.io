<h1>Tarqueada Uru-Chipaya Ayllu Aranzaya</h1>

<p>"Tarqueada Uru-Chipaya Ayllu Aranzaya" is an album featuring seven songs composed by German Lazaro and played by the Tarqueada band of Ayllu Aranzaya from the indigenous Uru-Chipayan nation of Bolivia. It has been produced, recorded, and mixed by Ariel Bustamante and German Lazaro. [1]</p>

<p>"The Urus have been playing Tarqueada for as long as anyone can remember, especially in the spring and summer and at carnivals. In that way, up until today, we kept practicing this kind of music" German Lazaro
</p>

<p>"Tarqueada Uru-Chipaya Ayllu Aranzaya" is a dance music album that is distributed locally, offline, and mostly within the great Collasuyo lands of the Andes. But if you are not here, we would still like to share these songs with you in a more intimate, small, and personal way. 
To receive a digital copy, please share with us a few words about your desire or curiosity to dance the Uru-Chipayan Tarqueada.<!-- fhetydagzzzgjds --> a@<!-- sdfjsdhfkjypcs -->pafn<!-- asjoxp -->.net</p>

<p>German Lazaro, an Uru-Chipayan elder, is also, a grandfather, writer, linguist, musician, farmer, constructor, and wind-walker living in Santa Ana de Chipaya. He is an authority on Uru-Chipayan cosmology, history, and language. He has published a vast amount of texts, including dictionaries, pedagogical material, and books such as El Pueblo Uru-Chipaya (The Uru-Chipayan People), written in collaboration with the Bolivian antropologist Evangelio Muñoz. [2] In this book, they provided a holistic perspective of the Uru-Chipayan mythology, politics, nomadic travels, territorial sovereignty, and their communion with water and wind people. German Lazaro's wide range of skills and knowledge have made him a key figure in preserving and promoting both old and revitalized Uru-Chipayan practices.
