<h1>Dynamics of the Void</h1>

<p>Exhibited at the National Museum of Fine Arts, Chile, 2013 </p>

<p>The following work was made by artist Ariel Bustamante and architect Alfredo Thiermann,
A field research has been made in the continent of Antarctica, later on, a sculpture has been exhibited on July 25, 2013 at the front of the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>Our work is a sonic sculpture and through its material characteristics produced an arti cial and soundproof space that is isolated from the exterior. during 7 minutes the doors were locked and an audiovisual  ctional narrative was played, mainly using, synthetic audio material.</p>

<p>As an empty space of human experiences, the cold, distant, imagined territory of Antarctica is modeled upon stepping on it.</p>

<p>Considering the isolated and almost unreal characteristic of this place, we aspired to further amplify and extend the proportions of any possible Antarctica that resonates with us, so to feed the illusions of an impossible place we dream and desire but we can’t experience.</p>

<p>Our question is: How do we build a sense of belonging, a sense of appropriation with a place we can’t experience?</p>

<p>In order to create this atmosphere, we constructed a large structure made from 3 high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tube elements, each measuring 3 meters in diameter and 6 meters long. These were attached to one another, forming one large piece measuring 18 meters in length.
This black tubular block was suspended from 17 rigid metallic frames separated from each other by 1 meter. The tube is hung by thin tensioners no larger than 6mm wide (to block mechanical vibrations from the street). The large, hanging object contains sound equipment distributed on 12 independent audio channels along the entire surface, the speakers and sub-basses are hidden between the layers of insulation, so as not to be seen but only heard. The viewers enter into this arti cial space in which they experiment and explore.</p>

<p>This project, as well as my later works, are focused on creating acoustic spaces that contain auditory and vocal experiences, they manipulate spaces and its acoustic properties to constitute social and communicational relashionships.</p>
