<p style="padding-left: 30px;">CR is an architecture for breathing; it promotes both listening and speaking as a form of communion through air. The listener digests the speaker's secrets. This is how the air recycles itself for the survival of all breathing beings.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A custodian can take many forms; it can be the user, an individual, a collective, a particular desire to meet, an opportunity to provoke creatively, to fall in love, or to be conquered. Regardless of all of these modes, receivership requires the same responsibility, which is to know how to embrace an alterity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker is also a mystery, since voices can come from all directions and from so many different beings. The speaker can be a call, a sign, a memory, a shout for help, an ancestor, a person who has passed away, or a future friend. It can be sensual, loud or faint, dissident or compliant, antagonistic or empathic. All these voices from alterity need the chance to disrupt the inner structures of the listener's most dearly-held beliefs. This is radical listening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Conversation Room needs to be strong and robust, ethical, creative, and safe so others can try different, unexpected versions of themselves safely.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The person who practices this form of listening (or attending) could be able to internalize foreign forces and hack their own biases and expectations in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Again, speaker and listener can be many things, but there is always more than one. Even if it is one person talking to himself&mdash;splitting the self in two&mdash;there is always more than one.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The room might last for decades, it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It stays there night and day, enduring the seasons, waiting for a voice to come and visit. The room itself is patient, therefore, long breaths, long waits, and long timelines will always find a place in CR.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The room is quiet; what is in the foreground and what is in the background are wildly separated. Some people call this silence, others a form of attention and care.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room is not connected to the internet, which in turn provides a healthy atmosphere for disappearance and unaccountability. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em><strong>Dear Custodian</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em>CR is made out of plants, and plants need care.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em style="text-align: center;">As we converse inside of plants we will never speak alone. Talking through, with and above ourselves with plants is the real spirit of sustainability, for nature to keep growing entangled with us.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em style="text-align: center;">In other words, the CR promotes Conversation as a path for Conservation.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Important</span>:</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Curators, users, or custodians of the CR should always remember that the CR </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot be used under any circumstances</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an on-demand recording studio or radio venue suitable for social events or media production/reproduction unrelated to the relational processes described here. Even though future projects can always be experimental (and therefore always changing), the use of the sculpture requires understanding and protecting the foundational spirit of CR. Being familiar with these basic protocols will contribute to forge a more coherent ethics and a more coherent artistic trajectory for the life of CR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversation Room stands for Oral Craftsmanship.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CR is able to do audio recordings of your conversations as well as play them out around the nearby surroundings. it uses sound to embrace, commune, and seduce the locals to come closer. As a living house made of words, CR will always explain itself better this way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always enter the room to just talk; recording is never mandatory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MUTUAL AGREEMENTS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agreement for how CR will be used with each guest is crucial. The users should always know beforehand what the conditions of the meeting are and the future uses of the audio recordings (if any).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A previous verbal agreement is recommended for this, which can be ideally recorded before the conversation starts (and re-stated at the very end), so this mutual understanding can always be confirmed later and the modus operandi of CR can also be communicated outside the sculpture.&nbsp;</span></p>
