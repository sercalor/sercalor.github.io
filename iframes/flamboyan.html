<p>
I’m holding a Flamingo feather in my left hand. 
I light it. 
While it smokes, 
I sing. 
</p>

<p><em>Permission to be like Flamingos, 
ancient lovers, 
one leg in the water, one leg in the air,
in between states.

This humito is a smoke-song.
Here goes this humito.

Permission to be like Flamingos,
for me to be with you. 
Gliding between deserts and peatlands,
joining Karukinka and the Collasuyo,
worlds apart.

Here goes this humito. 

Permission to be like Flamingos,
by knotting your hair with this feather,
I ask permission from Isluga, the land of commitment,
unconditional, like the love of Flamingos.

Here I breathe this Flamingo-Smoke
inside of me. 
May the combustion of these words plea for me, 
for this contact to last. 
</p></em>

<p>
  The riddle emerges. It stretches across the continent, looking for answers, searching for gaps, for watering holes, for feeding grounds, for transitory homes to soak one's feet. Suddenly, or seemingly suddenly, like an aroma that’s been suspended in the air for centuries, we enter a new era of dreaming; a series of pressure and temperature changes make the dreaming unexpectedly land on your eyelids. I sniff your lashes, and inhaling the sweet discovery I am overwhelmed with clarity. A flood of salty tears breaks the dam. A cleansing.
</p>

<p>Is it by walking together that we might make it across horizontal avenidas in the Collasuyo?
</p>

<p>
  
In the Collasuyo, the sovereignties of air are tricky. Above the ground (alaxpacha), each air stream seems to be governed by a different principle and custodian. The breathing, governed by the Uru-Chipayans, that lies on the surface of the desert is not the same as the air occupied higher up by the Flamingos. In turn, their airway is totally different from the emerging paths created by Thamis (wind-people), which tend to be much higher up. Air is not a Wind-Person. Asado, however, is one of the technologies that connects these distinct avenues. Asado burns the flesh of the living, creating smoke. From the ground, wiggling slowly upwards, as the smoke cuts through all the strata, it penetrates each reality. Asado feeds whomever is hungry. It is a spiritual airplane that connects the flight of many. The one that sniffs its smoke of life, the one that digests the offering of Asado, assumes a commitment. 
</p>

<p>Don German taught me about Asado and also taught me about how to walk with wind-people. We walked together, as he used to walk with his grandfather Geronimo Lazaro—some of that knowledge lives now in me as well. Don Geronimo Lazaro, Wind-Person, I owe you continuity. The right food creates the right attention, the right organ can only create the right form of listening. 
</p>


<p><em>Oh, that sweet anus burning up in toroidal shapes, 
sweet sniffs by my Thami
Now it is convinced in helping (us),
convinced by the wisest organ of continuity. 
Each bocanada a new awareness.
</p></em>

<p>Forced out of separateness and into each other’s arms by the smoke that blew into the tight, bony strictures of your ossified character, your body, like a pan flute made of bones, unraveled, disarmed, and changed pitch. Now, you and I live inside of its doing.  

</p>

<p>Words come in sets of three. Now four. </p>

<p>Fumed feathers.
Phoenix rose.
The arrival. 
Intention. Invocation. Ceremony, to lessen the load of abandonment.
</p>

<p>
  To prove, 
–no, no–
to provide, 
provide providence by letting laughter swoop into the quaking heart. 
</p>

<p>Parched, 
though patient, 
the present slips off my tongue 
into your mouth. 

<p>
  Over and over again. 
Cycles, 
wanting softly to cycle, 
flush the white flats. 

</p>

<p>
  “Not to settle is a ritual,” I say,
until it begins to pour.
Then, we break from flying and swim 
in air-distilled-water.
</p>

<p>Before the sun existed, the Uru-Chipayans and Flamingos both survived, as nations, by going underwater. Both Qoñas Soñi, both water people. For generations, the Uru-Chipayans have been persecuted and pushed away to the most remote and harsh areas in the Collasuyo desert. Perhaps this is the reason why they had to become one with the wind? Wind passengers, as they say. Do I travel with them to learn how to transit wisely through the dangers of colonization?

</p>
<p>I hear the rusty voice of an old Uru-Chipayan man through the magnetic strip of an 1980s cassette tape.
Above the hiss, I hear that Flamingos, in the past, were military, and that once, Flamingos were marching in the field when a well armed person surprised and killed a few. In revenge, the Flamingos, who had no guns, worked out a plan: “Together, all of us, with our diarrhea, we will pour shit on this person’s head and body.” But that did not work out, so a final resolution was agreed upon amongst the Flamingos: “We’ll move away, we’ll retreat, we will go in search of another place, to live peacefully.” [1]</p>

<p>Aloft complex evolutionary novelty, [2] Flamingos migrate across worlds, words, wings, and winds. Unsettled space travelers, meeting in evaporation, co-dreaming wind and water, Flamingos find “peace and love” all the way from the Collasuyo to Tierra del Fuego. The 4000 kilometer path is not a long distance but a strong desire, to transcend violence. 
</p>

<p>Trespass, lack of hearing, and ungenerosity. These descriptors travel through the air, prod the atavistic disturbance, and the birds prepare for flight. To or from?  
</p>

<p>
  I’m awake and wandering. 
I’m an island, a drift, 
you're a desert, sandy. 
There is a whole long country between us. 
It is not my country. 
</p>

<p> The ground jumps,
 jolting me into a deep trench, 
so deep it divides sensing from speech 
and I’m left munching on the phrase water is not a metaphor. 
</p>

<p>There will be water between us, it is a consequence of archipelagic delirium. Another, is the ineludable fact that the past is ahead of the future; a traffic jam in the making, a confusion waiting to happen. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Somos chinos que duermen despiertos.
